### Project Description
JobMatchAI is an  AIsystem designed to analyze a candidate's qualifications, skills, experience, and even their interests (based on resumes or profiles), the AI evaluates and ranks their compatibility with specific job roles. This system streamlines recruitment for employers and helps candidates find roles that align with their potential.

### The Problem statement
Recruiters and hiring managers often find it overwhelming to identify the right candidates for specific roles because of the sheer number of applications they receive, incomplete information, and the time-consuming nature of manual screening. On the other side, job seekers face their own struggles navigating through countless job postings to find opportunities that truly align with their skills, qualifications, and career goals.

### The Solution 
Faster hiring, more accurate candidate selection, and reduced manual workload for recruiters.
Better job alignment, improved career satisfaction, and increased chances of landing the right role for job seekers.
